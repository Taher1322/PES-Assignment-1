# PES-Assignment-1
Code for Assignment 1 for PES, ECEN-5813, Fall 2021 - Due Date >> 8/31/2021 @ 10:30 AM MDT

Using CodeLite IDE with GNU GCC compiler to run and test all the codes
The code contains .h and .c files 
.h header files are used to define functions and then called in main 
.c contains the production code as per functions
To test you can directly call the functions from main.c by passing parameters and test the return values
Other way to test the code functionality is to run test functions in main and get the output in serial terminal
Both ways works fine !!
