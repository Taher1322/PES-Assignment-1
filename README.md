# PES-Assignment-1
Code for Assignment 1 for PES, ECEN-5813, Fall 2021 - Due Date >> 8/31/2021 @ 10:30 AM MDT

I am new to commit in git(please bear for a while, I will learn it soon) but I have included all the files used in the project codes with some screenshoot .PNG file to make it easier for tester. 

1) Using CodeLite IDE with GNU GCC compiler to run and test all the codes

2) The code contains .h and .c files 

3) .h header files are used to define functions and then called in main 

4) .c contains the production code as per functions

5) To test you can directly call the functions from main.c by passing parameters and test the return values

6) Other way to test the code functionality is to run test functions in main and get the output in serial terminal

7) Both ways works fine !!
